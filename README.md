## c-elegans

find a list of all the datasets and compile them

1. Multilayer connectome of Caenorhabditis elegans (Bentley 2016) (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005283)
2. C.elegans Cell List (WormAtlas)
3. C.elegans Cell List (WormBase)
4. herm_full_edgelist
5. modified celegans db dump

experiment with the use of python packages to analyse the differences in datasets
1. Problog (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/244995125_Data_acquisition_and_modeling_for_learning_and_reasoning_in_probabilistic_logic_environment)

helpful in helping to identify most probable combination of neurons that make the core connectome of the worm

biological constraints:
1. wiring cost (energy efficency)
2. topology of network based on embryological origin
3. cost of new neurons vs saturation of network
4. extrasynaptic communication via NTs, neuropeptides and hormones
