# Abstract
Expanded WormBase to include the complete genomic sequence, gene prediction and orthology assignments from a range of related nematodes
This comparative data will enrich the C.elegans data with improved gene predictions and a better understanding of gene function

# Description:
WormBook: www.wormbook.org

# Data curation update
Concise descriptions for over 5597 genes (Â¼ of the protein coding genes in C.elegans)
2094 C.elegans gene structure changes
127 new genes
443 new isoforms
Based on either RNA-seq transcript data or on comparative gene analysis
11 changes to canonical genomic sequence
10 changes were 1bp
Largest was an insertion of 1469 bp
Alleles: over 10k alleles with molecular information, greatly facilitating structure-function studies. Sequencing efforts in polymorphic strains have now identified over 170k single nucleotide polymorphisms
Gene ontology?
Phenotype ontology?
Anatomy ontology
Expanded controlled anatomy terms and their relations
Descriptions of entire cell lineage of C.elegans
Describe the phenotypes caused by physical or genetic perturbation of anatomic structures
