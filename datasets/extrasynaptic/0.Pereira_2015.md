**Data for network construction**
- Connectivity data was taken from the latest release of www.wormwiring.org which containes updates to the original wiring diagram (White et al. 1986)
- Data from JSE and N2U worms were used
- Only connections that have more than 3 EM serial sections of synaptic connection are kept
- Connection between a neuron to itself were ignored

**Abstract**
- systematically map all cholinergic neuron types in the male and hermaphrodite _C.elegans_ nervous system
- find that ACh is most broadly used neurotransmitter and analyse its usage relative to other neurotransmitters within the contex of the entire connectome and within the specific network motifs embedded in the connectome
