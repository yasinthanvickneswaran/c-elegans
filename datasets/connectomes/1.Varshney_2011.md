**Data Acquisition**
- Assembled wiring diagram by consolidating existing data from both published and unpublished sources

White et al- The Mind of a Worm (MOW) (starting point)
  - extracted wiring data from diagrams, figures, tables and text
  - connectivity of each neuron, its synaptic partner, and synaptic type was manually entered into an electronic database
  - in the ventral cord, determining this level of synaptic specification was complicated by the fact that connections were recorded by neuron class
  - assigned proper connections to the appropriate left/right neuronby referring to White and coworker's original laboratory notebooks and original EMs

R.M. Durbin- the anterior portion of the worm
- Anterior connections needed an update as MOW did not specify the location of syanpses, integration proved difficult
- For these neurons, they obtained positional information by cross-referencing Durbin's data against original EMs and his handwritten annotations in White's laboratory notebooks
- Only synapses located in regions addressed by Durbin were included
- Connections in the middle and tail region of the worm were mostly unaffected by these updates.

**Differences in data and gaps**
-[Hobert O and Hall DH, unpublished] differences between GFP neurons and White's work have been observed
  - anterior processes of DVB and PVT could have been mistakenly switched in MOW
  - so they reversed the connections for neurons DVB and PVT anterior to the vulva
- reconstructions of neurons in the mid-body of the wor are incomplete
- from a combination of these published works
  - White et al 1986
  - Durbin RM 1987
  - Hall DH, Russel RL 1991
  - White et al 1976
- wiring data for 64 neurons had large gaps or were missing entirely
  - 61 of these were motor neurons in the ventral cord
  - 2 were excretory neurons (CANL/R) that do not appear to make any synapses
  - RID is the only process in the dorsal cord that extends over the length of the animal
 
**Updates to previous data**
- Using a White et al laboratory notebooks, they identified notes for full reconstructions of 24 of the aforementioned neurons
- Partial connectivity data for the remaining 38 were also available where 22 neurons have partial/missing dorsal side connections and 6 neurons have partial ventral side connections
- 600 updates were made to the original notes and published reconstructions
  -additions of previously missed NMJs between ventral cord motor neurons and body wall muscles
-large section on the dorsal side of the worm was never EM at high power magnification
  - produced new high power EMs of this dorsal region
  - 3 neurons (DA5,DB4,DD3) were obtained from these EMs
  - resource constraints prevented them from covering the entire dorsal gap
- reconciliation of discrepancies
  -561 synapses for 108 neurons (49% chemical "sends", 31% chemical "receives" and 20% for electrical junctions)
