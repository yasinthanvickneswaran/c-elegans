**Abstract:**
- Hermaphrodite nervous system consists of 302 neurons arranged in an invariant structure.
- There are 118 classes, 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 NMJs and 600 gap junctions.
- Look at appendix 2 for minor ambiguities (*link to be inserted*)

**Reliability of data**
1. Human error: when following long featureless process bundles, it resulted in switch processes.
2. Many processes run close to plane of sectioning and so it provides images with indistinct objects leading to problems in identification
3. Similar errors of process identification in area of poor image quality caused by dirt or loss of sections on grid bars



**Behaviour:**
- _C.elegans_ pass through 4 larval stages before reaching adulthood: L1, L2, L3, L4. Each stage is terminated by a moult.
- If food is scarce, animals can go trhough an alternative developmental sequence. A dauer larval form is produced at the L2-L3 moult.
- Several alterations to the endings of some sensory receptors on entering the dauer stage
- They also display chemotaxis and move up a gradient of chemical attractant or down a gradient of repellant.
- Shown to avoid high regions of osmolarity
- They actively maintain itself at an optimum temperature gradient.
- They respond to light touch by moving away from point of stimulation.
- The mechanosensory system to navigate through the interstices between soil particles in its natural habitat.
- The mating specific behaviour is only exhibited by the male. (additional neural circuitry for controlling copulation)

**Locomotion:**
- Movement is produced by dorso-ventral flexures of the body. It produces a sinusoidal wave that propagates along the length of the body. (anterior-posterior:forward)(posterior-anterior:backward)
- There is an extra degree of freedom of movement in the head. It can perform lateral and dorsoventral movements.
- The dorso-ventral flexures and surface tension forces constrain animals to lie on their sides.

**Structure:**
- _C.elegans_ consists of a tough impermeable elastic cuticle, laid down by a system of underlying hypodermal cells
- The body cavity is maintained at a high hydrostatic pressure relative to the outside. It acts on the elastic cuticle giving its rigidity.
- There are four longitudinal ridges running down the inside of the body cavity: two medial and two lateral.
- The ridges consist of hypodermis adjacent to a bundle of nerve processes (bounded by a basal lamina)
- There are four strips of muscle cells running 4 quadrants between these longitudinal ridges. There are no obvious attachment points at either end and have attachments to the hypodermis distributed along their length. They act to deform the cuticle elastically against stress produced by the turgor pressure.

**Feeding:**
- Food is pumped into the animal and processed by a prominent pharynx
- Pharynx is a self contained organ with its own musculature, epithelium and nervous system.
- It functions largely as an autonomous unit
- There are two interneurons that originate in the CNS and enter it.
- RIP (interneurons) are exclusively postsynapic outside the pharynx and mediate overall control of pharyngeal pumping from the CNS
- It is used for ingesting food (bacteria), concentrating it by filtration and grinding it.
- It is also used for secreting digestive enzymes from its gland cells.
- The processed food is pumped into the intestine
- Defecation is controlled by three sets of specialised muscles

**Excretory system:**
- It consists of a single excretory canal cell arranged in a "H" configuration
- Two arms of H run longitudinally down the lateral lines joined by a cross bridge, connected to the excretory duct on the ventral side.
- There are processes run anteriorly on the ventral surface of the ventral nerve cord until nerve ring is reached. This is where they terminate

**Reproductive system:**
- Hemraphrodite: consists of symmetrical pairs of uteri, oviducts, spermathecae and ovaries, which are joined at the uteri and connect to a vulva.
- Male: male gonad form a cloaca in the tail which is endowed with sensory endings (derived from male-specific neurons)
- They are generated post-embryonically along with other neurons in the male
- It also has extra ventral body muscles and muscles that control copulatory spicules.

**Nervous System**
- Organised into 302 neurons consisting of 118 classes (class size ranges from 1 to 13)

_Sensory transduction_
- sensilla (sense organs): containe one or a number of ciliated nerve endings and 2 non-neuronal cells (sheath and socket cell)
- socket cell: interfacial hypodermal cell acting to join the sensilum to the hypodermis
- sheath cell: (defined extracellular mileu for receptor endings). It is a glial-like cell that envelops the endings of neurons.
