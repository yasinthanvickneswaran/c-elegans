## Significant updates and corrections to previous data
DVB/PVT mixup.  The ventral cord processes of these neurons were crossed in MOW.  PVT extends to the head, DVB ends mid-body.  Previously reported: (WBG 16(1):24 (October 1, 1999)).

PVCL and PVCR.  In MOW these were switched at N2U ventral cord section 1656.

Sublateral motor neurons.  MOW contained no data for the sublateral cords anterior or posterior to the nerve ring, and no neuromuscular junctions for these neurons along the body. Synapses were first noted by immunofluorescence, then confirmed by sampling multiple animals (not reconstructed)

Lateral nerves were closely examined in multiple animals to assess synapses for the first time (not reconstructed except for short portions) (Ramirez-Suarez N.J., Belalcazar H.M., Salazar C.J., Beyaz B., Raja B., Nguyen K.C.Q., Celestrin K., Fredens J., Færgeman N.J., Hall D.H., and Bülow H.E. (2018) Axon-dependent patterning and maintenance of somatosensory dendritic arbors, Dev Cell. 2019 Jan 28;48(2):229-244.)

Motor neurons re-assigned as interneurons: RIM, RMF, RMG.  nmj's reported in MOW for the adult RMF could not be verified.

Interneurons reassigned as motor neurons: SAB, SIA, SIB.

Interneuron reasssigned as sensory neuron: DVA.

Amphid nerves were found to contain synapses among sensory dendrites and RIP, following first discovery in Pristionchus.

Synapses to hypodermis, both chemical and gap junctional, were occasionally reported in MOW but were not systematically scored until now.

Extensive gap junctional connectivity of hmc (head mesodermal cell) to muscle was previously noted (MRC notebooks) but never systematically assessed and reported.

PDB is considered to be an AS class motor neuron (AS12).  It shares all the characteristics of the other members of this class, except the route taken by its commissure differs by going first posteriorly before crossing the body and progressing anteriorly (the reason behind its unique name, J. White, personal communication).  In the male it has an extensive dendritic arbor involved in mating circuitry, as does AS11. 

Muscle arms of the bodywall muscles of the head (#1-8) were  traced to their NMJ inputs for the first time

## Male-specific neurons
There are two new classes of male-specific neurons: MCM (L and R) are interneurons in the head (Sammut et al. 2015, Nature 526, 385-390); PHD (L and R) are putative sensory neurons in the tail derived during the L4 larval stage by transdifferentiation of the phasmid socket cell PHso1 (Sulston et al., 1980; Molina-Garcia et al., https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/21/285320).

In Jarrell et al., the processes of PHD(L/R) were misidentified as branches of R8B.

In Jarrell et al., LUA and PHC were reversed.  Connectivity data given for LUA is in fact due to PHC, and vice versa.
AN3 of Jarrell et al. is AVF (verified by transgene expression of a synaptic marker (unpublished observations)).  AN3 was one of three interneuron processes of neurons with cell bodies in the head that could not be positiviely identified in the pre-anal ganglion.  The other two, AN1 and AN2, are tentatively assigned as AVH and AVJ, respectively.
