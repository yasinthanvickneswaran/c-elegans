## A cellular and regulatory map of the cholinergic nervous system of C. elegans

**Abstract**
- systematically map all cholinergic neuron types in the male and hermaphrodite _C.elegans_ nervous system
- find that ACh is most broadly used neurotransmitter and analyse its usage relative to other neurotransmitters within the contex of the entire connectome and within the specific network motifs embedded in the connectome
