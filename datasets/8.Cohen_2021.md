## A multi-scale brain map derived from whole-brain volumetric reconstructions

**Abstract**
-  nerve ring is derived from integrating the volumetric reconstructions from two animals with corresponding synaptic and gap junctional connectomes (Cook et al 2019)
-  _C.elegans_ connectome is not invariant, but that a precisely wired core circuit is embedded in a background of variable connectivity, and identify a canditate reference connectome for the core circuit.
-  Using this reference, they propose a modular network architecture of _C.elegans_ brain that supports sensory computation and integration, sensorimotor convergence and brain-wide coordination.
-  These findings reveal scalable and robust features of brain organisation that may be universal across phyla.
