**Data**
- N2U dataset: the "contin", "display2" and "synapsecombined" tables
  - contin table: individual identfier, the contin number of each neuron
  - display2 table: 3D structure of each neuron and coordinates of neuron's chemical synapses
  - synapsecombined: pre- and postsynaptic partners of each chemical synapse
- Focus:
  -structural properties within the nerve ring
  -considered the 20 microns of the worm's anterior part, removing neurites and synapses that are posterior to the position

**Formatting the dataset**
- positioned the postsynaptic structure on the clsoest centroid coordinate of the postsynaptic neurite
_Missing datatpoints_
- for synapses that were not registered on all partners, registered on the missing neurons by locating clsoest neurite segment to the synapse
- in cases where the closest segment was more than 2 micrometres away from the synapse, the synapse between two neurons was removed
- structure of few neurons in dataset was fragmented
  - missing data in the original EM images
  - segmentation errors

_Fixes_
- stitching the disjointed ends
- for disjoint segments with short gaps, they manually stitched the segments
- when such stitching was not possible, small parts of the neurite were removed from the main neurite.

**Assessing contact points between two neurites**
Two methods:
1. Contactome dataset (Cohen et al 2021) and Connectome (Cook et al 2019)
- Skeletal maps of neurons as (x,y) coordinates in EM image (Cook) 
  - in each EM image, N1 and N2 have a contract point and searched for minimal distance (contact point)
  - only works for single contact point
2. Distance between centroids of the neurite skeletons
- distribution of these distances showed skewness towards high distances
- set median of the distance distribution (=0.24 micrometres) as a conservative threshold
- both methods yielded similar results
