**Abstract:**
- Hermaphrodite nervous system consists of 302 neurons arranged in an invariant structure.
- There are 118 classes, 5000 chemical synapses, 2000 NMJs and 600 gap junctions.
- Look at appendix 2 for minor ambiguities (link)

**Behaviour:**
- _C.elegans_ pass through 4 larval stages before reaching adulthood: L1, L2, L3, L4. Each stage is terminated by a moult.
- If food is scarce, animals can go trhough an alternative developmental sequence. A dauer larval form is produced at the L2-L3 moult.
- Several alterations to the endings of some sensory receptors on entering the dauer stage
- They also display chemotaxis and move up a gradient of chemical attractant or down a gradient of repellant.
- Shown to avoid high regions of osmolarity
- They actively maintain itself at an optimum temperature gradient.
- They respond to light touch by moving away from point of stimulation.
- The mechanosensory system to navigate through the interstices between soil particles in its natural habitat.
- The mating specific behaviour is only exhibited by the male. (additional neural circuitry for controlling copulation)

**Locomotion:**
- Movement is produced by dorso-ventral flexures of the body. It produces a sinusoidal wave that propagates along the length of the body. (anterior-posterior:forward)(posterior-anterior:backward)
- There is an extra degree of freedom of movement in the head. It can perform lateral and dorsoventral movements.
- The dorso-ventral flexures and surface tension forces constrain animals to lie on their sides.

**Structure:**
- _C.elegans_ consists of a tough impermeable elastic cuticle, laid down by a system of underlying hypodermal cells
- The body cavity is maintained at a high hydrostatic pressure relative to the outside. It acts on the elastic cuticle giving its rigidity.
- There are four longitudinal ridges running down the inside of the body cavity: two medial and two lateral.
- The ridges consist of hypodermis adjacent to a bundle of nerve processes (bounded by a basal lamina)
- There are four strips of muscle cells running 4 quadrants between these longitudinal ridges. There are no obvious attachment points at either end and have attachments to the hypodermis distributed along their length. They act to deform the cuticle elastically against stress produced by the turgor pressure.
