## Connectomes across development reveal principles of brain maturation

**Abstract**
- use serial EM to reconstruct the full brain of eight isogenic _C.elegans_ individuals across postnatal stages to investigate how to changes with age.
- overall geometry of the brain is preserved from birth to adulthood, but substantial changes in chemical synaptic connectivity emerge on this consistent scaffold
- comparing connectomes between individuals between individuals reveal substantial differences in connectivity that make each brain partly unique.
- comparing connectomes across maturation reveal consistent wiring changes between different neurons
